The tower's doors open without a sound. Beyond them lies only darkness, and the promise of endless rooms.
It waits in silence, daring you to step inside...

They call it the Endless Tower.

No map can chart it, no adventurer has ever seen its summit. Its halls bend back on themselves, rooms
repeat yet never match, and stairways climb both up and down at once.

Some say the tower was built by the gods. Others, that it has a mind of its own, forever growing. Many
have entered seeking glory, riches, or the truth at its heart. Few have returned, and none agree on what
they saw.

Yet still, adventurers gather at its gates. For within its shifting walls lies a promise: that somewhere
beyond the endless doorsâ€¦ lies the entrance to the land of the gods, and the chance to receive the sacred
blessing.

You enter the first room, and already the exit behind you is gone. The only way is forward, deeper into
the unknown. Every step you take echoes endlessly. The tower feels empty, yet you know it is watching.\n\n""")
